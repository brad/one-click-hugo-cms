  After owning our house for 4 years, and all the repairs, yard work and
  expenses that come with that, it's safe to say we were ready for a change. A
  change of pace. A change of scenery. We were ready to become nomads and call
  the world our home.

It's hard to say how far back we should look to find that moment that we knew we would have a life of travel. Back in the early aughts Brad pursued an education in software engineering because well, he was highly interested and talented in it, but also because it lent itself to remote working. Shortly after meeting each other, we decided to move to southern California and start a new life together. After two years down there we decided to move back to Oregon. Then after 4 years in Eugene, even with our house in the perfect neighborhood and with a great group of friends and co-workers, we had itchy feet once again.

I'm not sure how Brad stumbled upon YouTube as a source of inspiration -- I know it wasn't on my radar until he showed me a video of a young couple sailing the world together. It was definitely inspiring and helped us picture what a mobile lifestyle could look like. A fire had been lit. Not long after, we found Gone With the Wynns on YouTube (a young RVing couple who had been full-timing for 7 years) and the idea of living in a motorhome took hold as a very approachable way to start a traveling life -- much more so than sailing, which neither of us are experienced in.
